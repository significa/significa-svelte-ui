/* 
  Elevated Links

  when you need to have a fully clickable card with another link inside, 
  you can use the `data-elevated` attribute in a link to make the entire card clickable.

  you can then have other sibling links that will work as intended.

  <div className="elevated-link">
    <a href="/link1" data-elevated>Title</a>
    <a href="/link2">find out more</a>
  </div>

  the whole card will link to /link1, 
  but the second link is still fully functional.
